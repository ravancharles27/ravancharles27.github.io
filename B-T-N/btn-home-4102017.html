        <p>Launched in 2017, the Black Talent Network aims to connect founders, It's meant to be! Someday you'll marry me! Someday you'll be my wife! (Biff turns to his car after Lorraine and Babs run off to see 2015 Biff in his car. 1955 Biff doesn't recognize him as his future self.) You always had your way with women, Biff. Get the hell outta my car, old man! Do you want to marry that girl, Biff? I can help make it happen.</p>

        <p>(George laughs at that.) Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy.</p>

        <p>Doc, wait. (The Libyans corner Doc and shoot him.) No!! Bastards!! (They go after him and he jumps in the Delorean and takes off.) Go. Go. (they follow) C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. (floors the gas, and as soon as the car reaches 88 MPH he is sent back to 1955.)</p>
