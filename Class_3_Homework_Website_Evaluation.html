            Primary color is red.<br />The mood of this website is energetic and inspiring.<br />The primary users are digital nomads and people interesting in nomad life.<br />I think the site is best suited to fairly tech saavy people, that may or may not represent nomads.<br />The site is really busy do it is unclear what the tasks and goals of visiting the site are.<br />Ultimately, I don't think the site delivers a great experience but it has really great features.
